   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Dear MN Games Community,</h3>
   <p>Thank you for being such a great user base and audience throughout the past 4 months. We aren't shutting down but we have decided for the past 2 weeks of school to give the teachers a break. Over the past 4 months we have grown and learned so much! At the beginning we were just a small 10 user site. Now we are a site with over 500 unique user sessions per day with users from over 15 states! This year we have made many great achievements and met many of our intended goals! But that would not have been possible without our amazinng team so to the MN Games Team Members I say thank you, for all of the many things you have helped us accomplish. We have improved so much and here I would like to list some of the amazing features we were able to add this year, 4 game websites, tournaments (More next year), our MN Secure Browser, and a team of over 15 people! These achievements were amzing but here is what we have in-store for next year, user authentication and user accounts (Also customizable profiles), MN Games Referral Program (More info later but will get an exclusive game site), better website design and interface/GUI, better customer support (Had trouble with that this year), and even more games and sites. Now as our website is winding down for the school year we want you to enjoy your last 2 short weeks of school. To the 6th graders I say, have fun in 7th grade to the 7th graders, have a good time in 8th grade and to the 8th graders, thanks for sharing this journey with us and we hope you enjoy high school. This summer our website will not be available to the public so enjoy your summer! Don't worry we will be working on the site as much as possible this summer and will have even more for you to do next year! Thanks for being such amazing users and doing so much for us. Have a great summer and we'll see you next year.</p>
